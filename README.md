🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Expert System

This project implements an AI-powered expert system designed to assist in the early detection and analysis of Alzheimer's Disease. Built using Python (Jupyter Notebook) and a clinical dataset, the system uses logical rules and medical indicators to make data-driven predictions and suggestions.
